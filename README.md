# Autism sentiment analysis platform

This platform allows medical professionals to quickly go through relevant parts of videos of children with autism to get faster diagnosis to the patients. This sentiment analysis was enabled by Microsoft's sentiment analysis API.

This project won the TechCrunch Paris 2018 Hackthon as part of the Microsoft AI Challenge. This hack was done in association with a French Startup, LearnEnjoy
